## General Information

This project was to build a single page website that was a product page for a business. I created the business and added a few product features to the website to enhance the viewer experience. This project was part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) coding basics courses and was the first project I ever built. She's simple, but I got my feet wet and I'm proud of her.

## Features

Product feature links

- Links to description of the features listed.

Video link to YouTube

- Video that shows the history of monocles.

Resizing

- If the screen size for the application is changed to 800px wide or less the page shifts to an image of a cat with a monocle.

## Setup

### Run Locally

1. Clone repo locally
2. Run `npm install` in your bash/command line
3. Run `npm start` in your bash/command line
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Available Commands

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

<!-- ### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,


For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together. -->

## Usage

At the moment there is no real functionality to the page, simply a place to see the product, however I plan on adding some functionality soon.

## Project Status

Project is: In Progress

## Room for Improvement

This project is over a year old now and having learned a few more things I'm re-visiting it to add some upgrades. I have already added a backend API to start but will need to add functionality as well.

Improvement Thoughts:

- Improve layout for better viewing
- Edit NavBar - soemthing has changed since original creation?
- Give functionality to links
- Create a SPA using React
- Allow for user registration and login
- Add shopping cart for orders

To do:

- [x] Add React components
- [x] Add forms and other interactive elements
- [x] Add routes to NavBar
- [x] Link to database
- [x] Add Authentication
